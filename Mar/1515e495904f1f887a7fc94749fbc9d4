Former Hard Livings gang leader Rashied Staggie started his day parole on Monday, the correctional services department said. "This phase and privilege of day parole begins today [Monday] and would end on September 17 2014, after which he would qualify for full parole placement up to the completion of his sentence in 2017," spokesman Manelisi Wolela said in a statement. He said stricter conditions had been set for Staggie this time. "The conditions include tagging for electronic monitoring to enhance compliance, confinement to his local district, no committing of any crime or use of drugs or alcohol; and no contact or involvement in any gang activities." Staggie was granted parole on September 23, but this was revoked in December because he met members of gangs and made unauthorised visits. He was sentenced in 2003 to 15 years in prison on charges of kidnapping and rape. In 2004, he received another 13 years for gun theft from a police armoury. The sentences ran concurrently, and he served 11 years before his release on day parole in September. "When he completes his day parole, Staggie would be liable for doing community services for a period of 18 months with effect from September 2014," Wolela said. "He will need permission to leave the prescribed magisterial district or to visit gangster hot spots such as Manenberg." Staggie is serving his sentence at Pollsmoor prison.
