THE lunar eclipse is over at Mamelodi Sundowns with the expected return of defender Bryce Moon for their Absa Premiership clash against BidVest Wits at Loftus Versfeld tomorrow. The marauding fullback has not seen any action this season, playing second fiddle to towering Ramahlwe Mphahlele, who is now out with injury. A roaring display against Gavin Hunt's Wits always deserves full marks. But with none of Hunt's teams rolling over for the opposition - they punish you for even the smallest of lapses - Moon and his teammates will have to be on their toes until the final whistle. Hunt knows Moon, and the entire Sundowns team, and what they are capable of. "We have been out of action for two weeks. You never know what we will get when we face Sundowns," said the Wits coach, one of SA's most successful coaches. "We do spend sleepless nights [plotting victory], just like we do with any other team in the league. So this does not make our opponents special." Wits and Downs are tied for third on the log, with seven points and identical goal difference after seven games. Despite injuries to some of their key players Downs have an impressive array of talent at their disposal in Cuthbert Malajila, Katlego Mashego, Kuda Mahachi and Ejike Uzoenyi. The home team appears to be a safe bet here.
