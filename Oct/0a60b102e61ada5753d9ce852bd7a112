BANYANA Banyana coach Vera Pauw has named a strong 21-member squad to represent the country at the 10th edition of the CAF African Women's Championship, which will be held in Namibia from October 11 to 25. The Sasol-sponsored Banyana have been drawn in Group B alongside Cameroon, Algeria and Ghana. They face Cameroon in their opening match on October 12 at the Independence Stadium. Goalkeeper Roxanne Barker is the only overseas-based player included in the squad, while the rest of the players all play for Sasol league teams in different provinces. "This is the worst part of my job as head coach, having to release players in such a great group was not an easy task. This was the most difficult moment of my career," said Pauw. "The players who have been released from the team have asked to remain and train with the rest of the team, and that, for me, showed great team spirit ... I hope we will be able to display that in Namibia."
